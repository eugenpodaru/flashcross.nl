            Flashcross is an active outdoor game where teams of cyclists compete in travel strategy and
            solving photo-puzzles: the reproduction of pictures of objects. Everybody from 18 to 99 years
            old, who knows how to sit on a bike, can join and win a Flashcross game. Whether you're good at
            cycling, orienteering, solving puzzles, or in just enjoying a nice sunday ride!
