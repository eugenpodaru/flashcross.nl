            <h2>Flashcross 1: Tulip Expression</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            It's spring; a perfect time for enjoying flower fields at the first Dutch Flashcross game!
            Bring out your bike, catch some tailwind, and head out for new adventures!
        </p>
        <p>
            The first game will take place on the <strong class="fc-strong">3rd of
            May</strong> from <strong class="fc-strong">09:30 to 16:00</strong>. It
            will take you through beautiful Noord Kennemerland in Noord Holland. This time of
            year tulips and other flowers for which the area is famous for will be blooming in the
            fields, so it should be quite the ride.
        </p>
        <p>
            The starting location will be in <strong class="fc-strong">Heiloo</strong>.
            From there you'll travel throughout the area trying to find and reproduce all the
            photo-puzzles within 4 hours. The finish is at 14:00, and results will be known at 16:00.
        </p>
        <p>
            So choose a friend, bring your bikes to Heiloo on the 3rd of May, and explore Noord
            Kennemerland! Regardless of whether you just like to ride or enjoy challenging competitions,
            it'll be fun!
