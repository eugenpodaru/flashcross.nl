                                A Flashcross game is a mixture of puzzling, sport, and photography. The objective of the
                                game is to cycle to various locations, and re-make photos that have been taken at those
                                locations as accurately as possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A Flashcross game is played with teams consisting of two people. A typical game takes 4
                                hours, and will have 15 locations to re-make photos at. Re-making a photo successfully
                                will give you points. The team who successfully re-made the most photos within the
                                allotted time, wins.
                            </p>


                            <h3><a name="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</a></h3>
                            <p>
                                At the start of the game all teams are given a map with 15 marked locations. They are
                                also given 15 assignments; one for each location on the map.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each assignment consists of four photos: one main photo and three bonus photos. If a
                                team wants to get points for any of the photos at a location, they have to at least
                                re-make the main photo. The main photo has to include one of the team members and both
                                bicycles to prove that they've actually visited the location.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The bonus photos are always taken within 50 meters of where the main photo is taken. If
                                a team doesn't first reproduce the main photo, they will not get any points for the
                                bonus photos.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each team can decide for themselves by which route and in which order they visit the
                                locations. You don't have to visit all locations if you don't want to.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When a team arrives back at the start/finish location, they hand over their photos to
                                the organizers, who then note down the return time and compare the photos to the
                                assignments. Once all teams have returned, the scores are calculated and the winners
                                are announced.
                            </p>

                                In order for a photo to give any points, it needs to match the assignment photo as
                                closely as possible. This means that the photo needs to be taken of the same object,
                                from the same direction, with the same angle, and the same distance.
                            </p>

                                If a photo does not match the above requirements, it will not be counted towards the
                                final score.

                                There are two types of photos; subject photos and foreshortening photos. The type of
                                photo is always marked on the assignment with either an "S" or an "F."

                                You need to find and take a photo of an object. What exactly you have to get is obvious
                                from looking at the assignment photo. Foreshortening, cropping and a little shift of
                                focus are not critical. The most important is to find the correct subject, the exact
                                thing or view that is in the assignment photo.

                                same spot and direction. Shifting the borders a little bit or extra elements at the
                                sides of the photo will not affect it passing the criteria. Shift of focus from
                                foreground to background or vice versa doesn't matter much as well.

                                The exact formula is as follows: <code style="font-family: monospace;">X ÷ Y</code>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Where X is the total number of teams, and Y the number of teams who have successfully
                                re-made that photograph. So if 10 teams participate, and 10 teams re-make a photograph,
                                they each get 1 point. If instead 5 teams would re-make that photograph, they would each
                                receive 2 points. If one team would re-make the photograph, they would receive 10
                                points.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The amount of points is also affected by the time you arrive back at the finish. For
                                each minute you are late, 2% is deducted from your total score.

                                Flashcross comes from Kharkiv, Ukraine. It was created by a group of friends who hated
                                sitting on sofas but loved cycling, puzzling, and adventure.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first event was organized in 2007 as a joke for their friends, with only 5 teams
                                taking part. These days the event is hugely popular in Ukraine and Russia. There are
                                about 1500 participants in 9 cities in Ukraine, Crimea, and Russia.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Flashcross.nl is the first attempt to bring the game outside its home region of Ukraine.
