                                A Flashcross game is a mixture of puzzles, cycling, and photography. The objective of the
                                game is to cycle to various locations, and re-make photos that have been taken at those
                                locations as accurately as possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A Flashcross game is played with teams consisting of two people. A typical game takes 4
                                hours, and has around 15 locations to re-make photos at. Visiting a location and
                                re-making a photo successfully will give you points. The team who gets the most points
                                within the allotted time, wins.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At the start of the game all teams are given a map with marked locations. They are
                                also given as many assignments; one for each location on the map.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each assignment consists of four photos: one main "location" photo and three bonus "puzzle"
                                photos. When a team arrives at the location, the team should start with re-making the
                                main photo. The main photo has to include one of the team members and both bicycles to
                                prove that they've actually visited the location.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The puzzle photos are hidden within approximately 50 meters of where the photographer is
                                standing while taking the main photo. If a team doesn't reproduce the main photo first,
                                they will not get any points for the puzzle photos.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each team can decide for themselves the route and in which order they want to visit the
                                locations. It's not possible to visit all locations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When a team arrives back at the start/finish location, they hand over their photos to
                                the organizers, who then note down the return time and analyze the team's photos
                                comparing them to the assignments. Once all teams have returned, the scores are
                                calculated and the winners are announced.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Score calculation usually takes about an hour after last team finishes. Awarding takes
                                place immediately after. Teams are allowed to take part in analyzing and defend their
                                photos. All results, maps and photos would be published on the website.
                            </p>

                                In order for a photo to give any points, it needs to match the assignment photo as
                                closely as possible. This means that the photo needs to be taken of the same spot,
                                with the same angle, the same distance and of the same object. :)

                                If a photo does not match the above requirements, it will not be counted towards the
                                final score.

                                There are two types of photos; subject photos and foreshortening photos. The type of
                                photo is always marked on the assignment with either an "S" or an "F" in the top left
                                corner.

                                You need to find and take a photo of an object. What exactly you have to get is obvious
                                from the assignment photo. Foreshortening, cropping and a little shift of
                                focus are not critical. The most important is to find the correct subject, the exact
                                thing or view that is in the assignment photo (from several similar subjects).

                                same spot and in the same direction. The composition should be the same as well. Shifting
                                the borders a little bit will not affect it passing the criteria. Shift of focus from
                                foreground to background doesn't matter.

                                Flashcross comes from Kharkiv, Ukraine. It was created by a group of friends who hated
                                sitting on sofas but loved cycling, puzzles, and adventure.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The first event was organized in 2006 as a joke for their friends, with only 5 teams
                                taking part. These days the event is hugely popular in Ukraine and Russia. There are
                                about 1500 participants in 9 cities in Ukraine, Crimea, and Russia.
